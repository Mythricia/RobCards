# Current TODO list

* Find a better way to store CardLayout and Card defintions... Should ask if separate files is preferable over one big file containing all of them. Also figure out what the friendliest way to add entries to each of the tables would be, right now it is a little confusing.
* Write documentation for how the CardLayout and Card definitions work and what features are available
* Get started on CardParser to convert layouts and card defs into a bundle of drawable objects
* Render drawable bundles onto off-screen Canvases as cards, decide whether to convert to Images or keep as Canvases for use within the application
* Allow easy browsing of the rendered cards within the app
* Export the rendered cards to disk as .png
* [Bonus] Consider making a way to assist in card layout using a user interface inside the app
* [Bonus] Visualize dice rolls and game calculations inside the app, making use of the already existing card data
* [ULTRA BONUS] Just make the digital game. rip.
