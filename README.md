# RobCards

### *What's it do?*

RobCards allows you to define layouts of cards or cardboard cutouts / panels for board games, as well as defining any number of variants of cards that use those layouts. Finally, make pretty renders of these cards, display them on the screen, and / or save the images to disk! Should be able to render print-ready images that can be used to actually print the cards on real card stock.
