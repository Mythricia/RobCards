# RobCards

Q: *What's it do?*

A: Allows you to define layouts of cards or cardboard cutouts / panels for board games, as well as defining any number of variants of cards that use those layouts. Finally, make pretty renders of these cards, display them on the screen, and / or save the images to disk! Should be able to render print-ready images that can be used to actually print the cards on real card stock.



# Current TODO list

* Get this whole thing up on GitHub with Robs blessing (since he owns the idea and eventually assets)
* Write documentation for how the CardLayout and Card definitions work and what features are available
* Get started on CardParser to convert layouts and card defs into a bundle of drawable objects
* Render drawable bundles onto off-screen Canvases as cards, decide whether to convert to Images or keep as Canvases for use within the application
* Allow easy browsing of the rendered cards within the app
* Export the rendered cards to disk as .png
* [Bonus] Consider making a way to assist in card layout using a user interface inside the app
* [Bonus] Visualize dice rolls and game calculations inside the app, making use of the already existing card data
* [ULTRA BONUS] Just make the digital game. rip.
