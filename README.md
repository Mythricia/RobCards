- Project is prototype / unusable stage right now. But feel free to read.
- Documentation is completely unfinished, take with a massive grain of salt.

## What's this?
RobCards allows you to define layouts of cards or cardboard cutouts / panels for board games, as well as defining any number of variants of cards that use those layouts. Finally, make pretty renders of these cards, display them on the screen, and / or save the images to disk! Eventually RobCards should be able to render print-ready images that can be used to actually print the designs on real card stock or cardboard.

**RobCards uses the very excellent [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) Lua game framework.**

Documentation lives at [RobCards @ GitHub Pages](https://mythricia.github.io/RobCards/)

## Contributing
You can certainly contribute to this project! Feel free to create Issues here on GitHub, or contact me one way or another.

If you wish to contribute code, I will gladly look at your pull requests, however, **please** read the guidlines below.

The [TODO](/TODO.md) document attempts to maintain a list of things that need work in the project. You could start looking there.


### Guidelines
Do not create PR's with code that attempts optimization or re-writing code for any particular idiomatic style or programming paradigm, as I will not accept. The code is intended to be easy to read and understand even for a beginner, furthermore performance on a small project such as this will be orders of magnitude better than it needs to be, even if the code is the slowest you could possibly write.

What I **will** accept, are contributions that add features in an elegant and easy to understand way, refactoring code that is needlessly messy or hacky, and so on.
